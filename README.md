## Synopsis
UESRPGCharGen is a utility for use with Unofficial Elder Scrolls RPG, 2nd Edition. It is meant to track character stats,
facilitate skill and characteristic checks, calculate damage, and generally make the playing of UESRPG much simpler.
## Motivation
This application is being developed in order to assist my friends in playing a rather complex tabletop system for the 
first time. I love the detail of UESRPG 2E, but it is a bit much to manage for new players, so I wanted to develop a
solution which would guide players through many of the common actions that are necessary to playing the game. This Work-
in-Progress is the result of that desire, and I hope that some day, new players of UESRPG outside of my friend group
will find this work helpful.
## Installation
Currently there are no pre-built binaries available. The application must be built with Visual Studio. The project
targets .NET 4.5.2, though I am sure it would work on lesser versions. Development takes place in VS Community 2015 and
2017, so both IDEs should be suitable.
